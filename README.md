# Learning Rust: Projects from 'The Rust Programming Language'

This repository is a collection of projects and exercises I am creating as I work through ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), an official book by the Rust development team. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, understand Rust concepts, and apply them in practical projects.

## About The Project

Each project in this repository is an exercise or an example from the Rust book. These projects cover a wide range of Rust topics, from basic syntax and concepts to more advanced features of the language. They serve as a hands-on way for me to learn and demonstrate my understanding of Rust.
